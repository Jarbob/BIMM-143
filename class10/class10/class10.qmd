## 1. The PDB databade

The main repository of biomolecular structure data is called the PDB found at: https://www.rcsb.org

Let's see what this database contains. TO do this go to PDB > Analyze > PDB statistics > By Experimental Method and Molecular Type

>Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

```{r}
pdbstats <- read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv")
pdbstats
```
```{r}
pdbstats$X.ray
```

The "," in these numbers is causing them to be read as character rather than numeric.

I can fix this by replacing "," fo rnothing "" wiht the `sub()` funciton

```{r}
x <- pdbstats$X.ray
sum(as.numeric(sub(",", "", x)))
```

Or I can use the **readr** package and the `read_csv()` function.
```{r}
library(readr)

pdbstats <- read_csv("Data Export Summary.csv")
pdbstats
```

I want to clean the column names so they are all lower case and don't have spaces in them
```{r}
colnames(pdbstats)
```

```{r}
library(janitor)

df <- clean_names(pdbstats)
df
```

Total number of X-ray structures
```{r}
xray <- sum(df$x_ray)
xray
```

Total number of structures
```{r}
total <- sum(df$total)
total
```

Percentage of structures covered by x-ray
```{r}
xray/total * 100
```

Total number of EM
```{r}
em <- sum(df$em)
em
```

Percent of data covered by em
```{r}
em/total * 100
```

>Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

Total number of proteins
```{r}
protein <- sum(df[1,8], df[2,8], df[3,8])
protein
```

Percent of structures that are proteins
```{r}
protein/total * 100
```

>Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?

231,029

## 2. Using Mol*

The main Mol* homepage at: https://molstar.org/viewer/ We can input our own PDB files or just give it a PDB database accession code (4 letter PDB code)

> Q4: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure?

>Q5: There is a critical “conserved” water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have

>Q6: Generate and save a figure clearly showing the two distinct chains of HIV-protease along with the ligand. You might also consider showing the catalytic residues ASP 25 in each chain and the critical water (we recommend “Ball & Stick” for these side-chains). Add this figure to your Quarto document.

>Discussion Topic: Can you think of a way in which indinavir, or even larger ligands and substrates, could enter the binding site?

## 3. Introduction to Bio3D in R

We can use the **bio3d** package for structural bioinformatics to read PDB data into R
```{r}
library(bio3d)

pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")
pdb
```

> Q7: How many amino acid residues are there in this pdb object? 

```{r}
length(pdbseq(pdb))
```

> Q8: Name one of the two non-protein residues? 

Mk1

> Q9: How many protein chains are in this structure? 

2 chains A and B

Looking at the `pdb` object in more detail

```{r}
attributes(pdb)
```

```{r}
head(pdb$atom)
```

Let's try a new function not yet in the bio3d package. It requires the **r3dmol** package that we need to install with `install.packages("r3dmol")` + `install.packages("shiny")`

```{r}
source("https://tinyurl.com/viewpdb")
#view.pdb(pdb, backgroundColor = "lightblue")
```

## 4. Prediciting function dynamics

We can use the `nma()` function in bio3d to predict the large-scale functional motions of biomolecules.

```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
adk
```

```{r}
m <- nma(adk)
plot(m)
```

Write out a trajectory of the predicted molecular motion:
```{r}
mktrj(m, file="adk_m7.pdb")
```
